# üö© Flags Dataset ‚Äì Data Exploration & Classification

This project focuses on the exploration and classification of a dataset from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.php), specifically the **Flags Dataset**. The project includes data cleaning, descriptive statistics, exploratory analysis, and classification modeling.

## üìä Project Overview

The primary objectives of this project were to:

- Perform descriptive analysis on selected features from the Flags dataset
- Discover potential relationships between variables using visual and statistical techniques
- Propose a relevant data-driven question for exploratory analysis
- Build and evaluate classification models on a training/test split
- Compare model performance using multiple evaluation metrics

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Libraries

- Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## üß™ Key Tasks Performed

### 1. **Descriptive Statistics**
- Selected 10 columns from the dataset for in-depth analysis.
- Calculated central tendency and dispersion metrics (mean, median, mode, std).
- Visualized distributions to identify skewness and outliers.

### 2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
- Explored relationships between selected variable pairs.
- Visualized correlations using heatmaps, scatter plots, and count plots.
- Proposed and answered an exploratory question based on the dataset‚Äôs context.

### 3. **Data Modeling**
- Chose two classification algorithms to model the target variable.
- Split the data into training and testing sets.
- Evaluated models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and confusion matrices.
- Compared the results of both models to determine the most effective approach.
